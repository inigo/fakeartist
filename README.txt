You will need a copy of the game to play.

== Hosting ==

There is a hosted version of this at http://fakeartistquestions.herokuapp.com which
is kept up-to-date with the latest GitHub code. This is hosted using Heroku's free
tier, so won't always be available.

== Data ==

The categories and subjects are taken from the conf/categories.csv file.
This is based on a Google doc collaboratively created by "alenros" from the BoardGameGeek
forums, and other BGG users. If you'd like more things in it, please send me pull requests.
